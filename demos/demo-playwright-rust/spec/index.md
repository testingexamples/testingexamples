# Spec

## Summary

This spec describes the exact browser-automation walkthrough that
`src/main.rs` performs: launching Chromium with `playwright-rs`,
navigating to the public testing-examples site, exercising five locator
strategies, and performing four form interactions, logging the result of
each step instead of asserting it.

## Scope

This spec covers the scenario implemented in `src/main.rs`: the target
URL, every locator/selector it uses, and every form interaction it
performs, together with what "this demo still works" means.

This spec does NOT cover: how to install Rust/Cargo/`playwright-rs` or how
to invoke the binary (see README.md), CI or build tooling, browsers other
than Chromium, or test-framework assertions — this program is a
walkthrough, not a test suite.

## Principles and rules

- This is a walkthrough program, not a test suite: it demonstrates locator
  strategies and form interactions by printing what it finds, and it does
  not assert expected outcomes with a test framework.
- The code and this spec describe the same scenario. If they ever diverge,
  that is a defect — fix it before making any other change.
- This repo depends on the crate published on crates.io as `playwright-rs`
  (source: `padamson/playwright-rust`), not the older, unrelated, abandoned
  crate published simply as `playwright` (`octaltree/playwright-rust`).

## Detail

Target URL: `https://testingexamples.github.io/en-001/practice/`

Locator strategies demonstrated, in order:

1. By id — `page.locator("#id-example-1")` — locates an element by its
   `id` attribute. Prints the element's text content.
2. By name attribute — `page.locator("[name=\"name-example-1\"]")` —
   locates an element by an attribute selector on `name`. Prints the
   element's text content.
3. By class name — `page.locator(".class-example-1")` — locates an element
   by CSS class selector. Prints the element's text content.
4. By link text — `page.locator("a:has-text(\"Link Example 1\")")` —
   locates a link (`<a>`) by its visible text `Link Example 1`. Prints the
   element's text content.
5. By XPath — `page.locator("xpath=//input[@type=\"submit\"]")` — locates
   an element with an XPath expression. Prints the element's `value`
   attribute (via `.input_value()`), since a submit input carries its
   label there rather than as text content.

Form interactions performed, in order:

1. Text input — `page.locator("#text-example-1-id")` — fills it with the
   value `"hello"` via `.fill("hello", None)`, then prints the resulting
   value via `.input_value()`.
2. Checkbox — `page.locator("#checkbox-example-1-id")` — checks it via
   `.check(None)`.
3. Radio button — `page.locator("#radio-example-1-option-1-id")` — checks
   it via `.check(None)`.
4. Select — `page.locator("#select-example-1-id")` — selects the option at
   index `0` via `.select_option(0, None)`, then prints the resulting
   value from `.input_value()`.

## Acceptance criteria

- The program navigates to `https://testingexamples.github.io/en-001/practice/` without
  error.
- Each of the five locators above resolves to exactly one element on the
  live page (no timeout or strict-mode-violation error from Playwright).
- The text input accepts the fill value `"hello"`, the checkbox and radio
  button end up checked, and the select ends up with the option at index 0
  selected.
- The program exits with status code 0 and no unhandled error.
