description: Explains and adapts the demo-selenium-javascript Selenium WebDriver walkthrough (locating elements by id/name/class/link-text/xpath, filling a text input, checking a checkbox/radio, selecting a dropdown option) against https://testingexamples.github.io/en-001/practice/; invoke when asked to run, explain, extend, or port this demo, or to adapt it to a different site or Selenium version.

This skill covers the `demo-selenium-javascript` repo: a small Node.js
script (`src/demo.js`) that teaches the core Selenium WebDriver locator
strategies (`By.id`, `By.name`, `By.className`, `By.linkText`, `By.xpath`)
and the basic form interactions (typing into a text input, checking a
checkbox, checking a radio button, selecting a dropdown option) against the
public demo site https://testingexamples.github.io/en-001/practice/.

To run it: install Node and npm, then
`npm install --save selenium-webdriver@latest chromedriver@latest` (see
README.md's Install section), then run `node src/demo.js` or
`./src/demo.js`. It launches a visible local Chrome window, prints the outer
HTML of each located element, fills in the form, and quits.

To adapt this demo to a different site: change the URL passed to
`driver.get(...)` and update every selector to match the new site's markup,
then update `spec/index.md` to match — the spec and the code must always
agree. To adapt to a newer `selenium-webdriver` version: update the
dependency and re-check the `By`, `Select`, and `Options` APIs used here for
breaking changes; the locator and interaction sequence itself maps 1:1 to
Selenium's stable core API and is unlikely to need to change.

This skill summarizes the repo. `AGENTS.md` and `spec/index.md` are the
source of truth — if this skill's summary ever disagrees with those, they
win.
