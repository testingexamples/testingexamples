# Demo Selenium Rust for Google Maps

Demonstration of:

* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) browser automation testing
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
* [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) build tool and package manager
* [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver) extends WebDriver by adding Chromium-specific capabilities

There is no official Rust binding from the Selenium project itself.
[`thirtyfour`](https://crates.io/crates/thirtyfour) — whose name nods to
selenium's atomic number, 34 — is the de facto Selenium/WebDriver client
for Rust, and is what this demo uses.

The exact scenario this demo describes (target URL, selectors, assertions)
is specified in [spec/index.md](spec/index.md); the code and spec must
agree.

## What this demo tests

Unlike the plain `demo-selenium-rust` walkthrough (which only logs what it
finds), this repo demonstrates a REAL test with real assertions — matching
the sibling `demo-selenium-javascript-for-google-maps` and
`demo-selenium-python-for-google-maps` repos test-for-test:

1. **Title test**: the Google Maps page title contains `Google Maps`.
2. **Search test**: filling the search box
   (`[aria-label="Search Google Maps"]`) with a query and pressing Enter
   updates the URL to contain the query.
3. **Zoom test**: clicking the zoom-in control
   (`[aria-label="Zoom in"]`) increases the zoom level embedded in the
   URL's `@lat,lng,zoomz` segment.

## Install

### Install Rust and Cargo

Install Rust (which includes Cargo) from <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>,
typically via `rustup`.

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### Dependencies

This repo's [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) declares `thirtyfour`, `tokio`, and
`anyhow` as ordinary dependencies, the same as any other Selenium Rust
project — so the code reads and would build like normal Rust. But per the
caution above, this repo does not actually run `cargo build` or
`cargo test` against the live site as part of its own maintenance.

## Run

Do not run this against the live Google Maps. If you have adapted this
pattern to point at a site you're allowed to test, the usual commands
apply (with a WebDriver server such as `chromedriver` already running):

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```
