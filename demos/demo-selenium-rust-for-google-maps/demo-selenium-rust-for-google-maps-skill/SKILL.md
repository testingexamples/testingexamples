# Demo Selenium Rust for Google Maps — skill

## What this demo teaches

This repo demonstrates `thirtyfour` (Rust's de facto Selenium/WebDriver
client — there is no official Selenium Rust binding) syntax and
interaction patterns against Google Maps, matching the sibling
`demo-selenium-javascript-for-google-maps` and
`demo-selenium-python-for-google-maps` repos test-for-test:

1. Page title contains `Google Maps`.
2. Searching `[aria-label="Search Google Maps"]` for a query and sending
   the WebDriver Enter key (`\u{E007}`) updates the URL to contain the
   query.
3. Clicking the zoom-in control (`[aria-label="Zoom in"]`) increases the
   zoom level embedded in the URL's `@lat,lng,zoomz` segment.

## The one rule that matters

**Never run `cargo build`, `cargo check`, or `cargo test` in this repo**,
and never let anything else do so either. Google's Terms of Service
restrict automated querying of its services, including Google Maps.
Review `src/demo.rs` by reading it against `thirtyfour`'s documented API
(see `spec/index.md`'s Sources) — not by compiling it.

## Adapting the pattern to a site you can actually test

1. Copy `src/demo.rs`'s three-test structure.
2. Point `driver.goto(...)` at a site you're allowed to test — for
   hands-on practice, use <https://testingexamples.github.io/en-001/practice/> (see the
   sibling `demo-selenium-rust` repo).
3. Update every selector and assertion, and update `spec/index.md` in the
   same change.
4. Only then run `cargo build`/`cargo test` (with a WebDriver server such
   as `chromedriver` already running).

This skill summarizes the repo. `AGENTS.md` and `spec/index.md` are the
source of truth — if this skill's summary ever disagrees with those, they
win.
