# Demo Playwright TypeScript for Google Maps

> **Caution:** Google's Terms of Service restrict automated querying of
> Google Maps. This repo exists to show the syntax and interaction
> patterns of Playwright's TypeScript API side by side with its sibling
> repos — it is not meant to be run repeatedly, or at all, against the
> live google.com. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the non-negotiable
> policy. If you want a target that's actually safe to run repeatedly,
> point Playwright at
> [testingexamples.github.io](https://testingexamples.github.io) instead,
> which was built exactly for that: stable ids, names, classes, and text
> that don't shift under you.

Demonstration of:

* [Playwright](https://www.playwright.dev/) browser automation testing
* [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) programming language
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
* [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) open source web browser
* Interaction patterns for [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)

This mirrors the framing already established at
[testingexamples.github.io/examples/google-maps/](https://testingexamples.github.io/examples/google-maps/),
which documents identical interaction patterns across Selenium,
WebdriverIO, and Playwright, in JavaScript, Python, and Rust. Google Maps
renders primarily to `<canvas>`/WebGL, so this demo — like the site-wide
reference — prefers accessible-name (`aria-label`) locators over
class-name locators for the search box and zoom controls, since those are
part of the accessible UI chrome rather than the map surface itself.

The exact scenario this demo describes is specified in
[spec/index.md](spec/index.md); the code and the spec must agree.

## What this demo checks

`src/demo.ts` contains three real, typed assertion checks, written from
Playwright's TypeScript API — but never executed against google.com:

1. The page title of `https://www.google.com/maps` contains `Google Maps`.
2. Filling `[aria-label="Search Google Maps"]` with a query and pressing
   Enter navigates to a URL that contains the query.
3. Clicking `[aria-label="Zoom in"]` increases the zoom level embedded in
   the URL's `@lat,lng,zoomz` fragment (e.g. the `15` in
   `@51.4816,-3.1791,15z`).

## Install

**Do not run `npm install` for this repo as an automated or scripted
step** — see the caution above and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). If a human has
read the caution and still wants to install dependencies to read type
information in an editor:

### Install Node and NPM

Install Node and NPM from <https://nodejs.org/>

Run this to confirm your version:

```sh
node -v
```

Output should be at least:

```stdout
v23.6.1
```

Run this to confirm your version:

```sh
npm -v
```

Output should be at least:

```stdout
11.2.0
```

### Install TypeScript

Install TypeScript and ts-node to run files:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node
```

### Install Playwright

Install Playwright latest version:

```sh
npm install playwright@latest
```

### Update

Run:

```sh
npm install npm@latest
npm upgrade
npm audit fix
```

## Run

**This code must never be executed against live google.com, in CI or any
automated tooling.** See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the non-negotiable
policy. The Run section is documented here only for completeness of the
repo's house style, not as an instruction to run it:

```sh
npx ts-node ./src/demo.ts
```
